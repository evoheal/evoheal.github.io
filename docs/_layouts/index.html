							<p class="major">
								Welcome to the Evolutionary Health Group of the
								<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://sph.cuny.edu/">City University of New York Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy</a>
								and the
								<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">National Center for Biotechnology Information</a>.
								Employing diverse computational approaches, we seek to uncover and explain deeply conserved mechanisms of host adaptation for pathogens ranging from bacteriophages to cancer cells to...words?

							<h2>Selfish Elements</h2>
							<p>
								The term <i>parasite</i> typically refers to an organism
								participating in a sustained inter-species relationship (symbiosis) in which this organism
								benefits at the cost of another. Parasites engaging in extremely asymmetric relationships
								are often bestowed the higher title of <i>pathogen</i>.
							</p>
							<p>
								This asymmetry makes pathogens <i>selfish</i>, often so selfish that hosts are under
								strong evolutionary pressure to evolve defenses against the pathogen or risk
								population collapse. In response, the pathogen evolves to evade these new host defenses,
								giving rise to a conflict which rapidly generates genomic novelty and reveals
								the rules governing a stable ecology.
							</p>
							<p>
								We endeavor to learn these rules for diverse pathogens ranging from large multicellular
								eukaryotes down to the smallest RNA viruses and establish conserved features. Relaxing
								our definition of organism, we may zoom in even further to consider this same conflict
								playing out within an individual genome among selfish genetic elements living in
								the blurry boundary of life. In turn, we believe we can begin to better understand
								the propagation of selfish elements in the complex nonliving systems that
								compose our public health infrastructure, from social media to government policy.

							<h2>Comparative Genomics</h2>
							<p>
								The growth in the number of nucleotides in publicly available genome repositories beats Moore's Law.
								Together, advances in computer engineering and next-generation sequencing technologies
								enable computational groups like ours to study a vast diversity of organisms.
							</p>
							<p>
								We have a special interest in viruses, and RNA viruses in particular. Almost all "priority pathogens"
								with recognized pandemic potential are viruses and the majority of zoonotic mammalian viruses are RNA viruses.
								Viruses evolve <i>fast</i> providing the opportunity to correlate genomic variation to environmental
								change as it happens in real time.
							</p>
							<p>
								A typical workflow involves aligning homologous sequences, inferring phylogeny, and estimating
								ancestral reconstructions to establish mutations. We focus on understanding the biology
								rather than software development but we build our own tools as necessary.

						<div class="content">
							<h2>Mathematical Modelling</h2>
							<p>
								The other key element of our work is the construction of mathematical models to explain and hopefully predict
								evolutionary dynamics. Evolution is inherently random and yet while the combinatorial space of all possible
								sequences long enough to make even the smallest genomes is incomprehensibly vast, under the same selective
								pressures, the same mutations are observed to repeatedly emerge.
							</p>
							<p>
								One area of particular interest is epidemic modelling. In this direction, we evaluate the predicted effects of
								public health intervention, including the long term impact of intervention on pathogen evolution. This most
								often begins with a system of ordinary differential equations (curves: 
								<b>
								<span style="color:#BFA5A3;">S</span>

								<span style="color:#79A314;">R</span>
								</b>
								model) and reassessed if complex spatial or stochastic effects are substantial over the timescale of interest.
							</p>
							<p>
								We are <i>very applied</i> mathematicians and are not experts in a particular discipline but instead seek
								to learn new techniques best suited to our biological interests. We often employ
								large scale simulations relying on straightforward numerical methods, but are always excited
								to apply new analytical approaches.

									In the face of a phage, how optimistic should a bacterium be?</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>
											Bacteria maintain diverse immune machinery to protect against phage infection.
											If that fails, an infected individual may undergo programmed cell death (PCD), an altruistic
											behavior, reducing the probability that the infection will spread within the
											community. Building on our
											<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.11.21.568103">prior work</a>
											focusing on understanding the features which govern the optimal strategy for somatic damage mitigation,
											we seek to understand how bacteria decide when to take one for the team.
											</p>
										</dd>
										<dt style="color: #FF5F5F">
										<i class="icon solid style1 fa-dna"></i>
										How do you decide if two proteins are "the same"?</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>
											Modern sequence alignment tools can establish homology among highly divergent proteins.
											The resulting deep alignments may then be organized into clusters given an appropriate
											metric over the sequence space. Percent identity with respect to a reference is
											often used to designate just two clusters - "the same" and "different". What percent
											identity threshold represents functional divergence, however, varies based on the
											genomic and ecological context. Using information theory, we are building a pipeline
											to segment deep alignments into groups that constitute the most efficient (in bits)
											representation of the underlying sequence space. It is our hope that this threshold-free
											approach is able to reproduce manually curated designations of evolutionary divergence
											as well as predict new functional groups.
											</p>
										</dd>
										<dt style="color: #574240">
										<i class="icon solid style1 fa-paw"></i>
										Should we be paying more attention to non-human cancer?</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>
											Addressing tumor evolution remains a major challenge for cancer treatment.
											Despite the availability of thousands of human cancer genomes through
											programs including TCGA and COSMIC, substantial patient heterogeneity
											makes predictions of individual responses to treatment noisy. Interactions between
											tumor mutations and germline variations remain poorly explored and even well
											characterized driver genes likely play additional, unknown roles in the process of metastasis.
											Cancer is also frequently observed in diverse non-human animals from clams to clydesdales
											but tumors from most species are rarely sequenced. This data could dramatically improve
											our understanding of the interactions between germline variations in driver genes
											present in other species and tumor mutations which, motivated by our
											<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-020-01276-7">prior work</a>,
											we expect to overlap with the landscape of human tumors even for distant relatives.
											We are building a database to collect publicly available tumor genomes across species
											and hope to identify several organisms for which the observed cancer incidence is high
											and the germline variations in driver genes will be informative for human health.

										</dd>
										<dt style="color: #79A314">
										<i class="icon solid style1 fa-comment-medical"></i>
										How do generative text responses differ from expert answers to clinical queries?</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>
											Generative text algorithms trained using much of the internet provide a mechanism
											to access technical information that can reduce the barrier to entry for non-experts.
											Clinical queries are of particular interest as effective generative responses may
											improve access to healthcare and reduce health disparities but ineffective responses
											may promote confusion and mistrust in the healthcare system. We are collecting an
											ensemble of questions and answers from the CDC and the NIH and posing these questions
											as prompts to popular generative text programs. Conserved differences in the structure
											of these answers will reveal limitations in generative text algorithms which may motivate
											new safeguards. Conversely, the generative responses may demonstrate useful features
											which may be incorporated into public health messaging.

										</dd>
										<dt style="color: #BFA5A3">
										<i class="icon solid style1 fa-temperature-high"></i>
										How is climate change impacting viral evolution?</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>
											Virus ecology and evolution is climate dependent and successful epi/pandemic prevention
											and response requires the incorporation of climate variables into epidemiological models
											and biostatistical workflows. Free, robust remote sensing data is made available through
											NASA; however, data accessibility remains a challenge for the epi/biostats community.
											As a part of the
											<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nih.gov/climateandhealth">NIH Climate Change and Health Initiative</a>
											we are building a web portal to help policy makers and public health practitioners
											utilize this data. In parallel, we are clustering metaviromes based on climate zone
											classification to determine climate-sensitive trends in viral abundance and evolutionary selection pressures.
